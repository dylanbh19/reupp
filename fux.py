This is happening because of pandas boolean indexing issues with Series that contain NaN or all-zero values. The error is in the EDA plots section where itâ€™s trying to filter mail columns.

## ðŸ”§ **Fix: Replace the mail column filtering logic (around line 1113)**

**BEFORE:**

```python
mail_cols = [col for col in all_cols 
            if col not in exclude_patterns
            and not any(col.endswith(suffix) for suffix in exclude_suffixes)
            and not any(col.startswith(prefix) for prefix in exclude_prefixes)
            and (weekly[col] == 0).mean() <= 0.5]  # Less sparse = likely mail data
```

**AFTER:**

```python
mail_cols = []
for col in all_cols:
    if (col not in exclude_patterns
        and not any(col.endswith(suffix) for suffix in exclude_suffixes)
        and not any(col.startswith(prefix) for prefix in exclude_prefixes)):
        
        try:
            # Safe sparsity check
            col_data = weekly[col].dropna()
            if len(col_data) > 0:
                sparsity = (col_data == 0).sum() / len(col_data)
                if sparsity <= 0.5:  # Less sparse = likely mail data
                    mail_cols.append(col)
        except (ValueError, TypeError):
            # Skip columns that can't be processed
            continue
```

## ðŸ”§ **And also fix the similar issue in plot_intent_mail_correlations (around line 1205)**

**BEFORE:**

```python
# Intent data is typically more sparse and has lower variance
if col_sparsity > 0.6 or (col_variance < col_mean and col_sparsity > 0.3):
    intent_cols.append(col)
else:
    mail_cols.append(col)
```

**AFTER:**

```python
# Intent data is typically more sparse and has lower variance
try:
    if col_sparsity > 0.6 or (col_variance < col_mean and col_sparsity > 0.3):
        intent_cols.append(col)
    else:
        mail_cols.append(col)
except (ValueError, TypeError):
    # Skip problematic columns
    continue
```

## ðŸ“Š **About Setting to 0:**

Setting outliers/stats to 0 when there are errors is actually **good defensive programming** because:

1. **It wonâ€™t set everything to 0** - only columns that have actual data issues
1. **It keeps the pipeline running** instead of crashing
1. **It logs warnings** so you know which columns had issues
1. **Most columns will process normally** and get real values

The real issue here is that pandas boolean operations are failing on some columns (probably due to mixed data types or NaN values), so the safe approach is to handle each column individually with try-catch blocks.â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹
